# wfm-testing
A testing project for warframe.market's API so I can learn how it works and what I can do with the data they provide to best optimize my Warframe trading.

# why tho?
'Cause I've got nothing much better to do this fine Sunday afternoon, and after I realized that I was stupid and warframe.market did have an active API, I thought there could be some cool applications for looking into how to optmized my in-game farming to get plat-worthy items.
